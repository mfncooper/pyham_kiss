PyHam KISS
==========

Overview
--------

This package provides a client implementation for the KISS TNC protocol,
providing send and receive capability via a TCP/IP connection. All commands
are supported in sending to the TNC; per the spec, only data frames are
supported when receiving from the TNC. Multi-port TNCs are supported.

This implementation has been tested with Direwolf as the server.

It is expected that developers working with this package will have some level
of knowledge of the KISS protocol. Those less familiar with the protocol may
wish to refer to the
`KISS protocol specification <http://www.ka9q.net/papers/kiss.html>`__
in conjunction with the documentation for this package.

About PyHam
-----------

PyHam is a collection of Python packages targeted at ham radio enthusiasts who
are also software developers. The name was born out of a need to find unique
names for these packages when the most obvious names were already taken.

PyHam packages aim to provide the kind of functionality that makes it much
simpler to build sophisticated ham radio applications without having to start
from scratch. In addition to the packages, PyHam aims to provide useful
real-world ham radio applications for all hams.

See the `PyHam home page <https://pyham.org>`__ for more information, and a
list of currently available libraries and applications.
